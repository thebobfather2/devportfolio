            <h2>Who is Bryan Pike?</h2>
            <p>
                Bryan is a web developer best known for creating Bobby Rabbits, an NFT company responsible for technology found in several Web3 projects. In December of 2012 he obtained a Marketing degree from Auburn University, which has provided him with a unique perspective on how to integrate consumer behaviors into project structures, aligning customer incentives and motivation with business goals and roadmaps. In 2013, Bryan obtained his Series 7 and 63 FINRA licenses and became a stock broker for E*TRADE. Seven years later in April of 2020, he ended his financial career with a Series 66 license managing a book of clients worth over $200 million. After nearly two years of pursuing entrepreneurship, Bryan successfully launched the Bobby Rabbits NFT with co-founders Bobby and Tyler, which has grown into a developer services business supporting more than half a dozen Web3 projects. He now lives in Atlanta, Georgia with his family and enjoys music production and videography in his spare time.
