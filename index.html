            <h2>Who is Bryan Pike?</h2>
            <p>
                Bryan is a web developer best known for creating Bobby Rabbits, an NFT company responsible for technology found in several Web3 projects. In December of 2012 he obtained a Marketing degree from Auburn University, which has provided him with a unique perspective on how to integrate consumer behaviors into project structures, aligning customer incentives and motivation with business goals and roadmaps. In 2013, Bryan obtained his Series 7 and 63 FINRA licenses and became a stock broker for E*TRADE. Seven years later in April of 2020, he ended his financial career with a Series 66 license managing a book of clients worth over $200 million. After nearly two years of pursuing entrepreneurship, Bryan successfully launched the Bobby Rabbits NFT with co-founders Bobby and Tyler, which has grown into a developer services business supporting more than half a dozen Web3 projects. He now lives in Atlanta, Georgia with his family and enjoys music production and videography in his spare time.

Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
